GSL/4.1 is a code construction tool. It will generate code in all
languages and for all purposes. If this sounds too good to be true,
welcome to 1996, when we invented these techniques. Magic is simply
technology that is twenty years ahead of its time. In addition to code
construction, GSL has been used to generate database schema definitions,
user interfaces, reports, system administration tools and much more.

This is the fourth major version of GSL, now considered a stable
product, repackaged together with its dependencies for easy building
from git.

* Starting with GSL
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: starting-with-gsl
  :END:

GSL is an acronym for Generator Scripting Language. And that is what it
does. You write scripts in gsl, feed it some data from some XML files
and it generates nicely formatted text files for you. These files can be
source code, a web site, a recipe book or whatever you like.

Read on to get you started with code generation!

[[file:images/README_1.png]]

** Hello World
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: hello-world
   :END:

Our first step is to make a "hello world" program in GSL. It's quite
simple. Make a file called =hello.gsl= that contains one line:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    echo "hello world"
#+END_EXAMPLE

To run this, use the following command:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    gsl hello
#+END_EXAMPLE

GSL is a simple language and you'll not have any difficulty
understanding its syntax, except in a few places where it does
specialised work. It will take you a little longer to understand what
you can do with GSL, but that is the real point of these articles. GSL
is not as rich as other scripting languages. It is a code generator
scripting language, not a programming tool. It lacks some control
structures, and it runs a little slowly.

Initially, GSL looks like any other scripting language. I can write
little scripts like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    amount = 1000
    year = 2006
    while year < 2026
        amount = amount * 1.05
        year = year + 1
    endwhile
    echo amount
#+END_EXAMPLE

Which calculates the value of my savings account if I were to leave it
untouched for twenty years, and the interest rate were steady at five
percent. Note these syntax aspects:

- =variable = expression= - Assign a value to a variable
- =while condition... endwhile= - Repeat a block while the condition is
  true

To run the above program, assuming it was saved in a file called
=interest.gsl=, I type this command:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    gsl interest
#+END_EXAMPLE

This executes the script and tells me that if I am really patient, I'll
be rich one day. Now I'm going to change this little program to make the
same kind of calculation for different amounts, rates, and years. Where
do I put these different terms and rates? The answer is, in an XML file.
The file is called =deposits.xml=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <deposits script = "interest.gsl" >
        <deposit amount = "1000000" rate = "5" years = "20" />
        <deposit amount = "500000" rate = "4" years = "10" />
        <deposit amount = "2500000" rate = "6" years = "15" />
    </deposits>
#+END_EXAMPLE

We change our script to give the result below.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .template 0
     for deposit
        year = 1
        accumulated = amount
        while year < years
            accumulated = accumulated * (rate / 100 + 1)
            year = year + 1
        endwhile
        echo "Original amount:" + amount + " becomes: " + accumulated
     endfor
    .endtemplate
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note these syntax aspects:

- =.template 0= - Start script (non-template) block
- =for <childname>= - Repeat block for all instances of child item
  called =childname=

We will run the new interest calculation script using this command:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    gsl deposits.xml
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note the change of command syntax. We first ran the GSL script. Now
we're running the XML file. This is one of GSL's features - you can run
XML files as if they were scripts. It's the =script == setting that does
the trick, working much like the hash-bang =#!= command in Linux.

Any GSL script, no matter how simple, works with an XML document loaded
into GSL's memory as a data tree. In our first =interest.gsl= script,
the data tree contains just this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <root script = "interest" />
#+END_EXAMPLE

GSL automatically creates this data tree when we ask it to execute a GSL
script.

If, on the other hand, we ask GSL to execute an XML file, it loads this
XML file into its data tree. Assuming we also asked for it, it will then
execute a GSL script against that XML tree. Technically speaking, GSL
searches the root item - which can have any name - for an attribute
called "script". We can put attributes into the root item in several
ways. One is to simply add them to the XML file, as we did. The other is
to place them on the command line, like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    gsl -script:interest deposits.xml
#+END_EXAMPLE

All variables that we define and use are stored in the data tree,
somewhere. This is the only data structure that GSL scripts work with,
and it can get very complex. For many people, understanding this
complexity is the most difficult thing about using GSL - hierarchies of
data are one of those things most human brains do not handle very well.
We use abstractions like XNF to make this simpler, but that is something
I'll discuss later.

** Templates and Scripts
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: templates-and-scripts
   :END:

GSL uses the term "template" to describe text that is output as
generated code. GSL works in two modes - script mode, and template mode.
When you execute a GSL script directly, as we did in the first example,
GSL starts in script mode. When you execute a GSL script indirectly,
through an XML file, as we did in the second example, GSL starts in
template mode. Try removing the =.template 0= and =.endtemplate= lines
and you'll see what I mean. The script just gets copied to the output
stream, the console, by default.

In template mode, GSL commands start with a dot in the first column. In
script mode, all lines are assumed to be GSL commands unless they start
with =>= (output) in the first column, in which case they are handled as
template lines.

Script mode is useful when you are doing a lot of GSL scripting work.
Often you need to prepare data, check the XML tree, and so on, before
you can start to generate code. Template mode is useful when you want to
output a lot of data, or actually want to generate code.

You can mix GSL commands and template code by putting a dot at the start
of lines with GSL commands. Like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .while year < years
    .   accumulated = accumulated * (rate / 100 + 1)
    .   year = year + 1
    .endwhile
#+END_EXAMPLE

I'm now going to generate a little HTML report of the different
calculations. The listing below shows the third version of
=interest.gsl=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .output "deposits.html"
    <html>
    <head>
    <title>So You Want To Be A Millionaire?</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <h1>So You Want To Be A Millionaire?</h1>
    <table>
    <tr><th>Original amount</th>
    <th>Interest rate</th>
    <th>Term, years</th>
    <th>Final amount</th>
    </tr>
    .for deposit
    .   year = 1
    .   accumulated = amount
    .   while year < years
    .       accumulated = accumulated * (rate / 100 + 1)
    .       year = year + 1
    .   endwhile
    <tr><td>$(amount)</td>
    <td>$(rate)%</td>
    <td>$(years)</td>
    <td>$(accumulated)</td>
    </tr>
    .endfor
    </table>
    </body>
    </html>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note these syntax aspects:

- =output <expression>= - Start sending output to the filename specified
- $(name) - Insert value of attribute in output text

To produce the HTML report run the same command as before:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    gsl deposits.xml
#+END_EXAMPLE

And then load deposits.html into your browser to see what it looks like.

If you're a web developer with any experience, you will see right away
what's happening. We're generating a web page dynamically, just like a
hundred other web tools. But there are significant differences:

Unlike a dynamic web page, here we explicitly specify the output file
ourselves, using the "output" command. We can output zero, one, or a
hundred different files if we want to.

We're working off a data tree that can be as complex as we want. Each
"for" loop opens a new scope, acting on a set of child entities. A
dynamic web page works off some flat data, coming from the browser or a
database. You can make web pages that work on a hierarchical data set,
but it's extra work.

GSL lets you load and navigate XML data so easily that you don't even
realize you're busy. The combination of an explicit script language like
GSL plus a hierarchical XML data tree works well.

** Modeling a Web Site
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: modeling-a-web-site
   :END:

I'm going to propose a simple abstract model for a web site, as an
example. When you understand this example, you'll have a much better
idea of how we design new models, so that you can design your own.

To start with, I'll explain how I design a new model, and then I'll take
you through the steps of building a code generator that brings it to
life.

Our model lets us build simple web sites. A web site is a mixture of
different types of document, for instance:

- HTML pages for the content.
- JavaScript for menus.
- CSS style sheets for look and feel.
- Images for icons and for cosmetics.

And so on. When we make a new model, it's worth asking the question,
"how would I make a thousand of these?" I.E., a thousand web sites.
Well, we'd have lots of content, which would be different for each web
site, possibly with some common parts. The content could definitely be
based on standard templates - it's unlikely we'd make each of a thousand
sites entirely from scratch.

If we used JavaScript menus, we'd presumably use the same code in each
site, changing only the menu content to match the structure of the site.

Most likely we'd use a unique CSS stylesheet for each site, to give each
site a unique look and feel, but they could also be based on a standard
template.

Finally, the images and icons would be a mixture of standard graphics
and customised graphics, depending on how pretty we want each site to
look.

Our model is going to be the basis for code generation, that is, the
mass production of as much of the above as is reasonable. To do this, we
need to make a compact and efficient statement of exactly what is needed
to produce each web site.

It's like constructing a thousand houses. It's expensive to design and
build each house as a unique thing. It's much cheaper to make a single
common plan, and then for each house, state the differences. So one
house might have a different roof shape, while another has larger
windows, but all houses share the same materials, wall and floor
construction, and so on.

When we mass produce something, we're clearly aiming for low cost and
consistent , and hopefully high, quality. It's the same with code
generation. So, let's get to our web site model. What information do we
actually need to specify?

- First, we need to know all the pages in the web site, so that we can
  build menus.

- Second, we need basic information for each page. Typically, I like to
  define a title and subtitle, an image (for pretty marketing purposes),
  and a block of content (which can be raw HTML).

- Third, we some information for all pages - for example, a logo and a
  copyright statement.

The next step is to sketch a model that can hold this information in a
useful way. Remember that we use XML as a modeling language. So, we
invent an XML syntax for our model. For each page, I'd like to write
something like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <page
        name = "name of page"
        title = "Title text goes here"
        subtitle = "Subtitle text goes here"
        >
    <content>
    Content HTML goes here
    </content>
    </page>
#+END_EXAMPLE

When I design new XML languages like the above, I use entity attributes
to hold single-line properties, and child entities to hold multi-line
properties or properties that can occur more than once. It just seems
more elegant than putting properties in child entities, since this
implies those properties can occur many times. It does not make sense
for a page to have more than one name, title, subtitle, or image in our
model, so we define these as attributes of the page entity. The iMatix
MOP tools use this style very heavily.

Once we've defined a set of pages, how do we tie these together into a
web site? Let's use a second model for the overall web site:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <site copyright = "copyright statement goes here">
    <section name = "name of section">
        <page name = "name of page" /> ...
    </section>...
    </site>
#+END_EXAMPLE

I've defined a =<section>= tag that breaks the pages into groups. Now
let's jump right in and make ourselves a web site. There's no better way
to test a model than to try using it. As an example, I'll make a new web
site for my local grocer, who has decided, finally, to go on-line.

** First Draft
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: first-draft
   :END:

We'll make the web site as several XML files. This is a design choice.
We could also make the site as a single large XML file. It's a trade-off
between ease of use (a single file is easier in smaller cases) and
scalability (it's not practical to edit a large site with hundreds of
pages as a single file).

To start with, we'll define the overall site like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <?xml version = "1.0" ?>
    <site
        copyright = "Copyright &#169; Local Grocer"
        script = "sitegen_1.gsl"
        >
    <section name = "Welcome">
        <page name = "index" />
    </section>
    <section name = "Products">
        <page name = "fruit" />
        <page name = "vegetables" />
    </section>
    </site>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note the first line, which defines the file as XML, and the =script=
tag, which tells GSL what script to run to process the data. We've
defined three pages. Let's write very a simple version of each of these:

Next, we will write three more short XML files as shown below. First the
index page:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <page
        name = "index"
        title = "Local Grocer"
        subtitle = "Visit the Local Grocer"
        >
    <content>
    <h3>Close to you</h3>
    <p>We're just around the corner, if you live near by.</p>
    <h3>Always open</h3>
    <p>And if we're closed, just come back tomorrow.</p>
    <h3>Cheap and convenient</h3>
    <p>Much cheaper and easier than growing your own vegetables and fruit.</p>
    </content>
    </page>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Next, the fruit page:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <page
        name = "fruit"
        title = "Our Fruit Stand"
        subtitle = "Lucious Tropical Fruits"
        >
    <content>
    <h3>Always fresh</h3>
    <p>Just like it was plucked from the tree last month.</p>
    <h3>Special deal</h3>
    <p>Any five pieces of fruit, for the price of ten!</p>
    <h3>Money back if not satisfied</h3>
    <p>We'll give you your money back if we're not satisfied with it!</p>
    </content>
    </page>
#+END_EXAMPLE

and last the vegetable page:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <page
        name = "vegetables"
        title = "Our Vegetables"
        subtitle = "Healthy Organic Vegetables"
    >
    <content>
    <h3>100% organic vegetables</h3>
    <p>All vegetables made from cardon, oxygen, and hydrogen molecules
    with trace elements.</p>
    <h3>Country fresh style</h3>
    <p>We don't know what that means, but it sounded nice!</p>
    <h3>Unique take-away concept</h3>
    <p>Now you can consume your vegetables in the comfort of your own home.</p>
    </content>
    </page>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Finally, here is the first draft of the web generation script. It does
not produce anything, it simply loads the web site data into an XML tree
and then saves this (in a file called =root.xml=) that we can look at to
see what live data the script is actually working with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .###  Since we run the script off the XML file, it starts in
    .###  template mode.
    .template 0
     for section
        for page
            ###  Load XML <page> data
            xml to section from "$(page.name).xml"
            ###  Delete old <page> tag
            delete page
        endfor
     endfor
     save root
    .endtemplate
#+END_EXAMPLE

Let's look at what this script does. First, it switches off template
mode so we can write ordinary GSL without starting each line with a dot.
GSL starts scripts in template mode if they are launched from the XML
file. It's useful in many cases but not here. So, we wrap the whole
script in =.template 0= and =.endtemplate=.

Second, the script works through each section and page, and loads the
XML data for that page. It does this using two commands, =xml= and
=delete=. The first loads XML data from a file into the specified scope
(=<section>=, in this case), and the second deletes the current page
(since the loaded data also contains a =<page>= tag).

Finally, the script saves the whole XML tree to a file. If you want to
try the next steps you must have installed GSL, as I described in the
last article. Run the script like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    gsl site
#+END_EXAMPLE

GSL looks for the file called =site.xml=. When the script has run, take
a look at =root.xml=. This shows you what we're going to work with to
generate the real HTML.

** Inserting Variables
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: inserting-variables
   :END:

When we generate output, we insert variable values into the generated
text. This is very much like using shell variables.

GSL does automatic case conversion on output variable. This is very
useful when we generate programming languages. For example, the $(name)
form outputs a variable in lower case:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    output "$(filename).c"
#+END_EXAMPLE

The $(NAME) form outputs the same value in uppercase:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #if defined ($(FILENAME)_INCLUDED)
#+END_EXAMPLE

And the $(Name) form outputs the variable in title case, i.e. the first
letter is capitalised:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ###################  $(Filename)   #################
#+END_EXAMPLE

One side-effect of automatic case conversion is that we'll often get
variables converted to lower case simply because we used the $(name)
form. If we don't want a variable to be automatically case converted, we
use this form: $(name:). This is also called the 'empty modifier'.

A second side-effect of automatic case conversion is that variable names
are not case sensitive. By default GSL ignores the case of variable
names so that $(me) and $(ME) refer to the same variable.

But putting empty modifiers in every variable expansion gets tiresome,
and GSL lets us switch off automatic case conversion, using this
instruction:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ignorecase = 0
#+END_EXAMPLE

This tells GSL, "variable names are case sensitive, and do not convert
variable values on output".

** Looping through Trees
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: looping-through-trees
   :END:

In our first draft we loaded each page into the XML tree and deleted the
original page definition. That was this text:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    for section
        for page
            xml to section from "$(page.name).xml"
            delete page
        endfor
    endfor
#+END_EXAMPLE

To generate output for each page, we're going to iterate through the
sections one more time. Since we're deleting old =<page>= entities and
loading new ones from the XML definitions, we need to iterate through
the sections and pages over again. This is the code that generates the
output for each page:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    for section
        for page
            include "template.gsl"
        endfor
    endfor
#+END_EXAMPLE

The include command executes GSL code in another file. We're going to do
all the hard work in a separate file, which I've called =template.gsl=,
so that it's easy to change the HTML generation independently from the
top-level GSL code. This is good practice for several reasons:

It's nice, in larger projects, that each big code generation task sits
in its own file where it can be owned by a single person.

We can add more templates - to produce other types of output - for the
same model very easily and safely.

And you'll see in later examples that we tend to write a single GSL file
for each output we want to produce. In XNF - the tool we use for
larger-scale code generation projects - these scripts are called
"targets".

** Building the Output
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: building-the-output
   :END:

The HTML template looks like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .template 1
    .echo "Generating $(page.name) page..."
    .output "$(page.name).html"
    <!DOCTYPE...>
    <html>
       ...
    </html>
    .endtemplate
#+END_EXAMPLE

Most of it is fairly straight-forward, though you do need to understand
how XHTML and CSS work (and I'm not going to explain that here).

- The echo command tells the user what's going on. It's polite to do
  this, although in realistic cases we'll also let the user suppress
  such reports using a 'quiet' option.

- The output command creates the HTML page.

- The text =<!DOCTYPE...>= to =</html>= is the body of the page, which
  I'll explain below.

The template starts by setting template mode on. This means that any GSL
commands we want to use here must start with a dot. It makes the HTML
easy to read and to maintain.

Let's look at the chunk of code that produces the site index. This is -
in our version of the web site generator - a menu that is embedded into
each page. The CSS stylesheet can place this menu anywhere on the page.
Here is the GSL code that generates it:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .for site.section
    <h3 class="menu_heading">$(section.name)</h3>
    <ul class="menu_item">
    .   for page
    <li><a class="menu_item"
        href="$(page.name).html">$(page.title)</a></li>
    .   endfor
    </ul>
    .endfor
#+END_EXAMPLE

The interesting thing here is that we say for site.section in order to
iterate through the sections. The site. prefix is a parent scope name,
it tells GSL "look for all sections in the current site". If we don't
use the scope name, GSL would look for all sections in the current scope
(the page) and find nothing. This is a common beginner's error.

Note that the parent scope is not always needed. These two blocks do
exactly the same thing:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .for site.section
    .   for page
    .   endfor
    .endfor
#+END_EXAMPLE

and:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .for site.section
    .   for section.page
    .   endfor
    .endfor
#+END_EXAMPLE

But the first form is simpler and I recommend you drop explicit parent
scope names when you are "tunneling into" the XML data tree.

Near the end of the template you see this construction:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .for content
    $(content.string ())
    .endfor
#+END_EXAMPLE

What is going on here? The answer is, we're grabbing the whole
=<content>= block, including all the XML it contains, as a single
string. Conveniently, XHTML is also XML, so we can read the XHTML
content block as part of our XML data file. As a bonus, GSL will also
validate it and tell you if there are errors, such as missing or
malformed tags.

The string() function returns a string that holds the XML value of the
specified entity. For the index page, it returns this value (as a single
string):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <content><h3>Close to you</h3><p>We're just around the corner, if you live near by.</p><h3>Always open</h3><p>And if we're closed, just come back tomorrow.</p><h3>Cheap and convenient</h3><p>Much cheaper and easier than growing your own vegetables and fruit.</p></content>
#+END_EXAMPLE

When we enclose this in =$(= and =)=, it writes the string to the
current output file. Thus we generate the body of the web page.

** Putting it All Together
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: putting-it-all-together
   :END:

In our first draft we read the XML data from several files and we
constructed a single tree with all the data we needed to generate code.
This two-pass approach is the way I recommend you construct all GSL code
generators:

- First, load all data into a single memory tree, denormalise and
  validate.
- Second, generate code from that single memory tree.

The final web site generator consists of three pieces. Here is the
revised web site generator.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .### Since we run the script off the XML file, it starts in
    .### template mode.
    .template 0
     ignorecase = 0
     for section
        for page
            xml to section from "$(page.name).xml"
            delete page
        endfor
     endfor
     for section
        for page
            include "template.gsl"
        endfor
     endfor
    .endtemplate
#+END_EXAMPLE

Here is the template for the HTML output.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .###  This whole script runs in template mode.
    .#
    .template 1
    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
        "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
    <html>
    <head>
      <title>$(page.title)</title>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="default.css" type="text/css"/>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div id="left_container">
        <div id="logo_container">
          <a href="index.html"><img id="logo" src="$(page.name).jpg"/></a>
        </div>
        <div id="menu_container">
    .for site.section
          <h3 class="menu_heading">$(section.name)</h3>
          <ul class="menu_item">
    .   for page
            <li><a class="menu_item" href="$(page.name).html">$(page.title)</a></li>
    .   endfor
          </ul>
    .endfor
          <h3 class="menu_heading">Copyright</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="copyright">
          <p>$(copyright)</p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="menu_heading"> </h3>
      </div>
      <div id="right_container">
        <div id="title_container">
          <h1 id="title">$(page.title)</h1>
          <h2 id="title">$(page.subtitle)</h2>
        </div>
        <div id="content_container">
        <!-- Page content -->
    .for content
        $(content.string ())
    .endfor
        <!-- End page content -->
        </div>
      </div>
    </body>
    </html>
    .endtemplate
#+END_EXAMPLE

To build the final web site, make sure the =site.xml= specifies the
correct script:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <site
        copyright = "Copyright &#169; Local Grocer"
        script = "sitegen.gsl"
        >
#+END_EXAMPLE

And then build the web site using the same command as previously:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    gsl site
#+END_EXAMPLE

The HTML template and the CSS file are made for each other. Note that:

- The HTML template assumes that each page has an image file with the
  name of the page, and extension "jpg".
- The colors and layout of the pages is defined in the CSS stylesheet.
- The menu is generated into each page.

** Exercise for the Reader
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: exercise-for-the-reader
   :END:

It's an interesting exercise to re-implement our code generator using
other code generation tools. For example, if you're familiar with XSLT,
try building the web site generator using that. You may find you need to
cheat, for example putting the whole web site model into a single file.

** Extending the Model
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: extending-the-model
   :END:

I've shown you how to design a simple model, and bring it to life using
GSL. This web site generator is actually based on one that I use for
some of my own web sites. You can extend this model in many directions,
for instance:

- You can change the type of menu, using a JavaScript drop-down menu
  instead of static HTML links.
- You can define your own modeling language for the HTML content.
- You can add other concepts and idioms to the model, depending on what
  you need in your web site.

But most of all, the point of this example is to teach you how to use
GSL in your daily work. As you've seen, it's easy to create models, and
it's easy to change them. This is the secret of code generation - you
don't need to get it right the first time. Models are hard to get right.
So go ahead and experiment, since GSL makes it cheap to change your
mind.

* Model-Oriented Programming
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: model-oriented-programming
  :END:

This article is aimed at the professional programmer. I'm going to
attack a complex subject, something that few people know about. It's a
new way of programming called "model-oriented programming". I'm not
going to ask you to throw out your programming languages or tools. MOP
works as a layer on top of everything you know today. I am going to ask
you to rethink what it means to "write a program", and to see that most
of the code you write could be better written by robots, meaning other
programs. And I'm going to teach you how to design and make such robots.

MOP works for every kind of area you write code for. Whether you write
games, Linux drivers, servers, applications, plug-ins, whether you use
Java, C, Perl, Ruby, Python, Gnome or KDE... once you start to see the
world as models you'll find yourself writing more code, faster, than you
ever thought possible.

In this article you will learn what MOP is, and why we invented it. I'll
also explain some of the underlying technologies.

Be warned. This might hurt a little. All I can promise is that if you
learn to use MOP you will use for the rest of your life, and wonder how
you ever worked without it.

** Becoming a Very Good Programmer
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: becoming-a-very-good-programmer
   :END:

I've learned a few things about software since I wrote my first small
program in 1981 or so. First: if it's not impossible, it's not worth
doing. Second: software design is about overcoming human limitations,
not technical ones. Third: very few people can actually design good,
useful, large-scale software systems, which for me is the goal of
programming.

In my experience there are these four main aspects to becoming a very
good programmer (which I hope to become, one day):

- Never throw out anything that works until it is really worn out. This
  mainly means writing portable code.
- Never solve the same problem more than once in parallel. This mainly
  means building tools.
- Solve the same problem often in serial. This means being willing to
  throw out code and rewrite it when you find better ways.
- Write code, write code, write code, until it is as natural as
  speaking.

Of course you also need talent, opportunity, and guidance, but a focus
on portability, obsessive tool building, and years of practice can turn
talent into real skill.

** Tools that Write Software
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: tools-that-write-software
   :END:

In this article I'll focus on the second part, making tools. There are
quite a few metaphors for software tools. For example, the Unix metaphor
consists of tools as filters: read some data, do some work, produce some
output. It's a simple model that lets you chain together tools. Linux
has many tools that work as filters.

A more subtle but much more powerful metaphor is to build tools as
languages. That is, when you come across a new class of problem, you
create a new language that lets you express solutions to those problems
in a simple and clear way.

Programming languages are one example of tools that work like this. Most
programming languages have their strong and weak points, but basically
they are all equivalent: they solve the general problem of
"programming", not specific problems like "constructing a firewall" or
"building a static web site".

Now consider HTML. This is a language that takes a different approach.
You don't use HTML to write programs: you use it to define structured
documents, and then you give these documents to programs that can do
useful things with the definitions, like show them on a screen.

It's worth comparing HTML to a language like PostScript, also used to
get documents looking pretty on paper or screen. PostScript is a
programming language (a threaded stack-based interpreter descended from
Forth, in fact). People have written, for example, web servers in
PostScript. No writer or designer actually sits down and writes
PostScript, though people did this before HTML existed.

I sometimes use a tool that turns HTML pages into PostScript documents.
Now, as a writer, I can use HTML to write my documents and then push a
button to turn this HTML into PostScript. What I am actually doing is
converting a descriptive language into a programming language. A
HTML-to-PostScript converter lets millions of non-technical people
suddenly produce perfect programs at will. Millions of people who never
think of themselves as "programmers" can write PostScript, via
higher-level abstractions like HTML. And the PostScript programs they
produce are much better than an average PostScript programmer can write
in a reasonable time.

** Abstractions and Modeling Languages
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: abstractions-and-modeling-languages
   :END:

HTML is in fact a "modeling language", a language used to describe some
system or entity. Modeling languages are very interesting because they
provide levels of abstraction that programming languages cannot even
conceive of. Abstraction lets you define and use high-level concepts
like, "this is a document title", without having to specify what that
actually means, on paper or on the screen. Abstraction relies on
concepts that have enough meaning to be useful, without being too
detailed. For example, "the web" is a useful abstraction for "various
URL formats, protocols for transferring such resources, clients and
servers that implement such protocols, and collections of resources that
are thus interconnected".

Abstraction is an important concept. It is one of the keys to solving
complex problems. Let me give you another example of abstraction. We can
build an application using a shell script that does each step. This is
not abstract, it is a literal set of steps. A makefile is more abstract:
it adds the abstractions of "file type" (based on extension) and
"target" and specifies how we transform one type of file into another in
order to build a specific target. There are more abstract descriptions
of projects too. Each time we make a good abstraction - a simple view
that hides complex details - we eliminate a layer of manual work.

Now imagine you could use modeling languages as a way of writing
programs. Instead of writing Perl, or Java, or C++, or Ruby, you would
describe some kind of model and then press a button. In fact this is not
a new idea: I've worked with systems that have done this, more or less
successfully, for twenty years.

Historically, computer scientists have tried to make programming
languages more powerful by adding functionality and by adding
programming abstractions. The underlying assumption is that since
programming languages are general purpose, they must be the best tools
for building software. Adding general purpose programming capacity gets
more and more complex as we reach for more abstraction. Thus we get
languages that are so complex that to master them is a full career.

This is, I believe, a mistaken approach. Complexity is difficult to
control, and complex languages (like Perl and C++) have a reputation for
producing complex and hard-to-maintain code. As a programmer, I have
quite a problem investing so much in any single language.

The trick that I've found (since I'm lazy and don't have the patience to
read 500-page guides to programming languages) is to create simple
abstractions - models - that solve useful problems, and to use these
models to generate code, just as we produce documents on screen and on
paper by generating code from abstractions like HTML.

For naive users, a model is a visual thing, but for us programmers, a
textual modeling language is much more useful. There exist many modeling
languages, and as I said, it is not a new concept. For example, in 1991
I wrote a tool, [[http://legacy.imatix.com/html/libero/][Libero]], that
turns finite state machine models into code. Libero was extremely
useful, and it is still part of our toolbox today. What it does is take
a state machine model (a text file), and turn that into code in
arbitrary languages (we made code generators for twenty or so
programming languages). State machines are a very useful model for
writing programs, but that's a different story.

Libero took me about three months to build, time that I've won back on
many projects. In a general sense, Libero is like the HTML-to-PostScript
convertor. It takes a definition written in an abstract modeling
language and turns that into code that makes the model come to life. The
generated code is always perfect, and as invisible as the PostScript
code.

** Leverage to Move Mountains
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: leverage-to-move-mountains
   :END:

I'm coming to the point of this article. This kind of model-to-code tool
is very useful. It gives you leverage. That is, the ability to move
mountains. It is much easier, faster, cheaper to change an abstract
model than it is to change the code that makes it work. Look again at a
PostScript program and now imagine the work needed to change a H1 item
to H2.

Good models let you work 10 to 100 times faster than any programming
language. As long as you stick to the problems the model was meant for,
there is really no downside, no reason to prefer PostScript over HTML
for writing texts.

I've said that part of being a world-class programmer is the ability to
make useful tools. But how do you, as a programmer, make a tool that
compiles a modeling language into code? You need to solve four main
problems:

- You need to learn, borrow, adapt, or invent useful models. This is not
  easy. Good models like finite state machines and hierarchical
  documents took many clever people many years to invent and refine.

- You need to define a language that lets people make such models.
  Again, getting this right is delicate. There are hundreds of ways to
  write state machines, just as there were hundreds of document markup
  languages before HTML, most being far too complex and thus useless.

- You need to build a parser that can read this language, check it, turn
  it into internal structures, optimise those structures, etc. Needless
  to say, writing parsers is not easy, there exist whole sets of tools
  just to solve this problem.

- You need to build a code generator that can take these internal
  structures and spit out the final code in whatever target languages
  you want to produce. Writing code generators is a black art. There are
  almost no books on the subject, no standard technologies.

If you've ever studied how compilers work, it's much the same problem.
What I'm talking about is building compilers for modeling languages.

** Case Study - OpenAMQ
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: case-study---openamq
   :END:

Modeling languages and programming languages can overlap. For example,
objects are a type of model. The biggest problem with putting models
into the programming language is that for real, large problems, we need
many different types of model, and these cannot be expressed in a single
language. Languages that attempt this become too complex to work with.
Imagine attempting to describe a hierarchical document using objects,
and compare this to writing some HTML by hand.

I'll explain with a large case taken from a real project,
[[http://www.openamq.org][OpenAMQ]]. This is an AMQP messaging server.
We used C as the target language for portability and performance, but we
actually designed the software as lots of high-level models. Each
modeling language was part of a code generation process that produced
real code. We used modeling languages for:

- Classes to encapsulating functions.
- Finite state machines for building protocol handlers.
- Project definitions for building and packaging sources.
- Grammar definitions for building parsers and code generators.
- Grammar definitions for communication protocols.
- Test scripting language.

The key to making these different modeling tools was cost. If it was
cheap to design, test, and use modeling languages, we could cut the
research and learning time dramatically.

Since I wrote Libero almost twenty years ago, I'd been working with
Jonathan Schultz to make better technologies for building modeling
languages and the code generators that bring them to life. We finished
the last of the main tools in 2005, and we then had technology that let
us design and deploy new modeling languages in a matter of weeks. The
process was so fast, and so efficient, that we were able to generate
almost 100% of the middleware server, a half-million lines of C code,
from about sixty thousand lines of modeling code.

The downside is that anyone wanting to understand the code had to learn
the five or six models we use. The upside is that they only had sixty
thousand lines of code to read, not half a million.

Let me take you through the main parts of our architecture:

- The basic technology is GSL, the programming language that we use to
  build code generators. Yes, you can write a web server in GSL, but
  that would be pointless. GSL is aimed very much at spitting out huge
  volumes of perfect code. GSL is an interpreter, it runs as a command,
  just like Perl or another scripting language.

- The second main technology is XML, which we did not invent of course,
  but which we happily adopted in 1997, having spent several years
  designing our own very similar meta-languages. We use XML in a
  simplistic way, to model data, not to do any kind of complex document
  manipulation. No stylesheets or namespaces, thus.

- The third main technology is XNF, which is a tool for building
  model-driven code generators. We start to get meta here. XNF (for "XML
  Normal Form") lets you define the grammar of an XML-based modeling
  language. From that grammar XNF produces parsers and a framework into
  which you plug hand-written back-end code generators. XNF is a
  modeling language for code generators. XNF is the basis for all our
  complex modeling tools, including XNF itself.

These tools - which are included in the OpenAMQ distribution's =base2=
project - are somewhat unusual. The techniques of code generation are
not well understood, and no teams have ever pushed these techniques as
far as we have. I don't promise that it will be easy to understand -
abstraction can be hard to grasp - but once you "get it", you'll be able
to produce tools that solve your programming problems ten times faster
than using any other technique.

** Other Model-Driven Architectures
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: other-model-driven-architectures
   :END:

Using models as the basis for designing applications is not new. I've
worked with many tools that promised "an end to programming" through the
magic of point and click modeling. Some of these - such as UML
(Universal Modeling Language) - have become industry standards. In my
experience, these tools do not work except as expensive and slow
documentation tools.

Perhaps my opinion of classic modeling tools such as UML have been
influenced by watching them being abused on large projects. The typical
scenario is that a big team of analysts work for a year to produce a
"model", which is then thrown out as a second team of developers write
the actual code.

The fundamental problem is that no single modeling language can cover
the variety needed to solve real world programming challenges. Just
imagine someone suggesting that UML could be used to write a Linux
device driver, or a high-performance game. That's a joke! Yet my team
uses models to design and build very technical, very high-performance
software. You just need the right models.

Classic MDA tools attempt to do everything with a single modeling
language. This is doomed to failure except within a very narrow niche of
work. Indeed, it is more expensive to "not write code" using a language
like UML than to simply write the code in Java. Just as a single
programming language cannot cover all abstractions, neither can a single
modeling language.

To succeed with a model-driven architecture, you need a way to build,
test, and improve a variety of different models, each solving one
specific domain. What you need is not a single, do-it-all modeling
language, but a technology that lets you build arbitrary modeling
languages.

** Why use MOP?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: why-use-mop
   :END:

Despite the trendy name, MOP is really about solving real problems in
the most efficient possible way. Let's look at the main advantages my
team gets from using MOP:

- We have to write much less code to get the same results. I call this
  "leverage". One line of modeling code can be worth ten or twenty lines
  of a programming language. Using less code has many knock-on
  advantages: we work faster, better, and cheaper.

- We get high-level models of important aspects of the system. All
  systems have key models, but they are usually hidden in the code and
  impossible to verify, formalise, or exploit fully. When the model is
  turned into a concrete language, it makes the software much better.

- We can produce extremely high-quality code. This is an effect of doing
  code generation: the generated code we produce has no errors, and is
  as good as a human programmer can write, consistently.

- We write less internal documentation, and often none at all, since
  each model is documentation.

- We are immune to technological changes since MOP is entirely abstract
  from specific programming languages, operating systems, and trends. It
  can take years to develop really good models but they work for
  decades.

There are also disadvantages:

- People do not rapidly understand or trust the approach. I've been
  accused of over-investing in tools (sometimes more than half the cost
  of a project goes into modeling tools). The look on the client's face
  when we deliver version after version of impeccable software in
  impossibly short deadlines is worth it.

- Programmers do not rapidly understand the models. It takes time to
  learn each one, sometimes weeks or months.

So, MOP is best used in small, skilled, and long-lasting teams (like
iMatix) that solve highly complex and critical problems. Before you can
use MOP in a project you need complete confidence of the people paying
for the work. If you're writing software for yourself, it's easy. If
you're writing software for other people, this can be a hard sell. MOP
can also be used to give structure to larger development teams, but it
is a lot of work to train mediocre people to use sophisticated models.

The sad thing in the software business is that few people actually
understand that better techniques save money. Still, there is no
pleasure, as a programmer, in writing bad code using bad tools. So,
learn to use MOP, then convince your bosses that they will save money,
right away, by using this. Everyone wins.

** A Short History of Code Generation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: a-short-history-of-code-generation
   :END:

To understand and use MOP you need to appreciate code generation as a
technology. I first started writing code generators in 1985, and I've
seen these tools evolve through several stages (in my own work, but also
in the general domain):

- /Hard-coded code generators/ that take some meta-data (a model) and
  output code using print statements. This is the most common, and the
  most limited form. Typical examples are all the classic "code
  generators" built into products.

- /Template-driven code generators/ that use symbolic insertion to
  inject meta- data into a template. This technology makes it much
  easier to write new ad-hoc templates. Typical examples are any
  technology that produces dynamic web page.

- /Scripted code generators/ that use a high-level language to
  manipulate meta- data and then inject it into templates. This
  technology makes it much easier to write new ad-hoc code generators.
  Typical examples are XSLT, GSL and some other scripted code generation
  languages.

- /Meta code generators/ that build code generators. This technology
  makes it possible to construct code generators for very complex
  modeling languages. The only examples we know are iMatix tools such as
  XNF and ASL.

Our first versions of GSL were born in 1995. We moved onto XML in 1997.
The problem of writing the code generator scripting language (GSL) is
largely solved, and at iMatix we don't consider this a priority task. At
some point we want to rewrite GSL to be a lot faster, but what interests
us now is using MOP techniques to solve difficult problems.

** Myths about Code Generation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: myths-about-code-generation
   :END:

Code generators are often seen as a technological burden, rather than
useful tools. I suspect that this is because primitive code generators
(which covers most code generators) are so painful to use. Some of the
common myths about code generation are:

- /Code generators only work for simplistic cases/. This is often true,
  but only because most code generators are simplistic.

- /Generated code is unreadable, and generated code is low quality/.
  This is often true because their authors focus on the
  application-specific problem, rather than on making the template easy
  to modify and improve. In a template-based code generator the code can
  be as good as or better than hand-written code.

- /Code generators are expensive to make/. This is typical of hard-coded
  code generators where the slightest change to the template means
  modifying, compiling, linking, and distributing a new release of the
  code generator.

- /Code generators are too much effort to use/. This says more about
  tool designers than about the problems that the tools solve.

- /Code generators are complex/. This is true: all abstractions are
  internally complex - look at the work required to write a good web
  browser or web server.

GSL solves most of these problems, and even a beginner can make useful
code generators for interfaces, database management, XNF solves the last
problem - it applies MOP to MOP itself, letting us make sophisticated
code generators much more rapidly than by hand.

** The Correctness of Generated Code
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-correctness-of-generated-code
   :END:

When you use a tool that produces large amounts of code for you, you
will naturally ask, "how do I know the code is correct". You need to be
able to trust your tools.

A code generator, luckily, is not random. It is like a simple compiler:
take high-level construct, translate into target code. If there is a bug
in this translation step, you will get target code that has bugs.
Luckily, it's easier, not harder, to get correct code from a machine
than by hand. I'll explain how we do this:

- Overall, we are quite strict about how we build our code generators.
  That makes bugs in the code generators rarer, and easier to find.

- When we start a new code generator, we build it gradually, and of
  course we inspect the code that it produces as we develop it.

- As we make the code generator more sophisticated we build a regression
  test suite that lets us catch any new errors in old code very rapidly.

In any programming environment, the key to producing good code is to
test heavily, and to use appropriate automation, i.e. tools. When we say
the "correctness of generated code", we really mean, "how to avoid bugs
in the code generator".

Since we use the MOP approach to build the code generators themselves,
we get very good code generators, cheaply. It is the same concept as a
"self-hosting" compiler. On many projects where we've used MOP, I'm able
to deliver hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and say, with
confidence, "there is not a single bug in this code".

** Command-line Syntax
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: command-line-syntax
   :END:

To run GSL, use one of the following syntaxes:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    gsl -<option> ... -<attr>[:<value>] ... <filename> ...
    gsl -a -<option> ... -<attr>[:<value>] <filename> <arg> ...
#+END_EXAMPLE

If the filename has no extension, GSL tries to find an XML file with
that name, or with the extension =.xml= (recognised by the =<?xml...>=
tag on the first line). If it finds no XML file it tries to find a file
with that name or the extension =.gsl=, which it interprets as a GSL
file.

Options currently recognised by GSL are:

- -a argument: Pass arguments following filename to GSL script
- -q quiet: suppress routine messages
- -p parallel: process files in parallel
- -s:n size:n set script cache size - default is 1000000
- -h help: show command-line summary
- -v version: show full version information

Command-line attributes are loaded with an XML file and are available to
a script. This allows paramaters to be passed from the command line to
the script. The attribute script can be set to the name of a GSL file to
be interpreted.

If GSL found an XML file, it loads it, then looks for an attribute named
script of the top-level item. This name is used to find a GSL script to
interpret. If GSL found a GSL file, it begins interpreting it without
loading an XML file.

** Concepts
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: concepts
   :END:

*** Scalar Data Types
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: scalar-data-types
    :END:

GSL recognises two scalar data types: numeric and string. It generally
makes no formal distinction between them; if a value looks numeric, then
it is treated as such, otherwise it is treated as a string. If strict
typing is required, the type conversion functions =conv.number= and
=conv.string= can be used.

*** Structured Data Types
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: structured-data-types
    :END:

GSL also understands structured data types. Structured data types are
modelled on XML; they have a name, attributes and children. Attributes
and children may be of a scalar type or (unlike XML) a structured type.
An attribute effectively represents a 1:1 link while children represent
1:n links.

Structured data types are used to represent underlying data, and the
attributes and children are based on their structure. The archetypal
case is XML data; its particularities mean that children are also XML
items, attributes may only have scalar values while both children and
attributes may have any name.

*** Constants
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: constants
    :END:

Constants express a constant value of one of the two scalar types. A
string constant is specified with either single- or double-quotes as
delimiters, for example: ="ABC"=. String constants may continue over
several source lines. The line break is considered part of the string
constant, unless the last character in the line is a single backslash
(=\=) in which case neither the backslash nor the line break is part of
the string. A numeric constant is a simple number with an optional sign
and optional decimal characters, for example 123 and -0.3.

*** Scopes
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: scopes
    :END:

According to The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing, © 1993-2004 Denis
Howe:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The scope of an identifier is the region of a program source within
  which it represents a certain thing. This usually extends from the
  place where it is declared to the end of the smallest enclosing block
  (begin/end or procedure/function body). An inner block may contain a
  redeclaration of the same identifier in which case the scope of the
  outer declaration does not include (is "shadowed" or "occluded" by)
  the scope of the inner.
#+END_QUOTE
GSL extends this usage so that a scope also has an alias, or name. When
we refer to a scope, we generally do so by its alias rather than by the
region in the script where it is defined.

All data access in GSL begins with a scope; that is, there is no such
thing as data unrelated to a GSL scope. Note that it is not always
necessary to explicitly specify the scope (see [[Referencing Scopes]]
below).

A scope defines a mapping from GSL data space onto the underlying data
structures. Its name is typically the same as the name of its underlying
structure; the principal reason for using a different alias is to
differentiate two data structures with the same name.

Scopes are opened (created) and closed (terminated) by matching pairs of
GSL instructions: for/endfor, new/endnew and scope/endscope. These
instructions must be nested; that is they may not overlap. At any point
in the script there is therefore a series of open scopes, ranging from
outer (opened earlier) to inner (opened more recently).

In addition, GSL predefines a number of scopes; these are considered to
have been opened before any scopes opened by the script.

**** Referencing Scopes

In general, scopes may be referred to in a variety of ways: by alias, by
number or implicitly. When referring to a scope by its alias name, open
scopes are searched, from innermost to outermost, for a scope with the
specified name. If there is more than one scope with the same name, only
the innermost can be referred to by name. In addition, scopes may be
declared with no alias, in which case they cannot be referred to by
name.

When referring to a scope by number, 1 refers to the outermost scope, 2
to the second outermost scope and so on. Alternatively 0 refers to the
innermost scope (this is very useful), -1 refers to the second innermost
scope and so on. In fact the situation is slightly more complicated than
this. Scopes may be declared as 'unstacked', meaning that they do not
appear in the sequence of numbers, either positive or negative.

A unstacked scope with no alias could not be referred to at all and is
thus disallowed.

A scope may be recast with a new alias, stacked or unstacked, with the
=.scope= instruction.

**** Predefined Scopes

Before processing a script, GSL defines several scopes. These need to be
taken into account when referring to a scope with a positive number.

- The first predefined scope is called =global= and can be used to hold
  global data. Its underlying data structure is a symbol table; it may
  have attributes with any name and any type (scalar or structured), but
  no children.

- The second predefined scope is called =gsl= and holds GSL internal
  data. NB. At the current moment there is a namespace clash between the
  scope =gsl= and the instruction =gsl=. This can be avoided by the use
  of square brackets [gsl] to reference the scope. The problem will
  disappear when the gsl instruction is deprecated.

- The third predefined scope is called =class= and holds the classes
  registered with GSL. These are typically: file, string, env, conv,
  math, sock, thread, xml, time, regexp, proc and diag. They should be
  documented below.

- The fourth predefined scope is called =root=. It refers to an XML item
  also called =root=, which is typically used as a parent for all other
  XML structures.

- The fifth and final predefined scope is the top-level XML item from
  the XML source file, if one was specified.

*** Data Specifiers
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: data-specifiers
    :END:

A data specifier is the means by which you access an item of data. GSL
provides a variety of ways to access a particular piece of data.

**** Scopes
As mentioned above, all data begins with a scope. The underlying data of a scope may be accessed by simply referencing the scope. For example
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    global.foo = root
#+END_EXAMPLE
assigns the XML structure referred to by the scope =root= to the
attribute =foo= of the scope =global=. Recall that the underlying data
of this scope is a symbol table whose attributes can hold structured
data.

**** Attributes
Attributes are referenced by the use of the period (=.=) For instance to display the value of the attribute =name= of the XML structure referred to by the scope =root= you could use:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    echo root.name
#+END_EXAMPLE

**** Implicit Scope Referencing
If, instead of explicitly specifying the scope =root= in the above example, you used:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    echo name
#+END_EXAMPLE
GSL would search stacked scopes, from the innermost to the outermost,
for one that defines the attribute =name=. Assuming the scope =root=
does not define an attribute =name= but the scope =global= does (we
understand that neither the scope =gsl= nor the scope =class= defines an
attribute =name=), this code would output the value of the attribute
=name= of the scope =global=.

This form of GSL is useful for two reasons. Firstly it makes for shorter
and easier-to-read code, when the location of the attribute is not in
question. Secondly it allows the value to be inherited from outer to
inner scopes.

Notice that the above example contains some ambiguity: does =name= refer
to an attribute =name= or a scope =name=? GSL searches first scopes then
attributes within scopes to find a match. If you wish to match only an
attribute, then use the alternative form:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    echo .name
#+END_EXAMPLE

**** Structure Flattening
What if, in the above example, the scope =global= defined an attribute
=name=, but this attribute were not a scalar value but an XML structure.
Since the instruction =echo= can only deal with scalar values, it
requests a flattened value of the structure. The meaning of a flattened
value depends on the structure in question; for an XML item it refers to
the value of the item.

Look at the example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    global.name = xml.load_string ("<A value = \"2\">Hello</A>")
    echo name
    echo global.name.value

    2004/09/20 16:36:25: gsl/4 M: Hello
    2004/09/20 16:36:25: gsl/4 M: 2
#+END_EXAMPLE
In addition to this implicit flattening, you can also explicitly request
the flattened value of a structure as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    global.foo = name.
#+END_EXAMPLE
Notice that this form resembles a request for an attribute with no name;
this is the desired effect.

****  Navigating Children 
Just as the period (=.=) accesses an attribute of a structure, the
member (=->=) construct accesses a child. For instance

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    global.parent->child
#+END_EXAMPLE
accesses the (first) child called =child= of the structure referred to
by the attribute =parent= of the global scope.

A more sophisticated version of this structure exists:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    global.parent-> child (value = "2")
#+END_EXAMPLE
accesses the (first) child called =child= for which the condition
=value = "2"= is TRUE.

The detail of how this works is that a scope called =child= is opened
for the duration of the evaluation of the condition. This underlying
data for this scope is the child (called =child=) of global.parent. The
typical use for such a structure is when the child defines an attrbute
=value= so that the expression is used to locate the particular child we
want, the one whose attribute =value= is 2.

As a final detail, the scope opened during the evaluation of this
expression may clash with other scopes called =child=. For this reason,
the following expression may be used:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    global.parent-> child (baby.value = child.value, baby)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The second argument =baby= indicates that the name of the scope created
to evaluate the condition should be =baby=.

**** Identifiers
An identifier is the generic term used for GSL scopes, attributes and
children. It is restricted to a combination of alphanumeric characters
and the underscore (=_=) and must begin with a letter or an underscore.

As the underlying data may not have the same restrictions on its name
space, and because GSL has a certain number of reserved words which may
clash with identifiers, identifiers may be surrounded by square
brackets. Inside square brackets, just about anything can be used. Use a
backslash (=\=) tn introduce a special character, two backslashes to
make a backslash.

**** Case Sensitivity 
GSL has two modes of handling the case of identifiers. In the default
mode, GSL matches names without regard to the case (upper or lower) used
to specify them. In certain substitutions GSL modifies the case of the
value of the identifier to match the case used to specify the attribute
name. In case-sensitive mode, GSL matches names taking into account the
case, and does not modify the case of the result. See the description of
subsitutions for details.
To change modes, set the value of the identifier =ignorecase= in the gsl
scope to 0 or 1. Eg: ~[gsl].ignorecase = 0~.

*** Expressions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: expressions
    :END:

GSL expressions are much the same as expressions in other high-level
programming languages. They include the following operators:

- Multiplicative :: ~*, /~
- Additive :: ~+, -~
- If/Default :: ~??, ?~
- Comparative :: ~=, <>, >, >=, <, <=~
- Safe comparative :: ~?=, ?<>, ?>, ?>=, ?<, ?<=~
- Logical :: ~|, &, !~
Operator precedence is standard (multiplicative, additive, if/default,
comparative, logical) and brackets are treated as you would expect.
Logical operators treat zero as FALSE and non-zero as TRUE.

GSL optimises expression evaluation to the extent that the second
operand of a binary logical operator (=|=, =&=) is not evaluated if the
result of the expression is determined by the first operand. This allows
you to use expressions such as

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    defined (X) & X
#+END_EXAMPLE
since the second operator is not evaluated when X is undefined.
The default operator allows undefined expressions to be replaced by
another expression. The value of

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <expr1> ? [<expr2>]
#+END_EXAMPLE
is equal to the value of =<expr1>=, if defined; otherwise it is equal to
the value of =<expr2>=, whether or not the latter is defined. If the
second operand =<expr2>= is omitted, then the evaluation of the
expression is safe, that is, GSL does not object (when this is feasible)
to the result of the expression being undefined. This feature can be
used in symbol definitions and substitutions to make GSL accept an
undefined expression. See the description of these instructions for
details.

The safe comparative operators return the same result as their
equivalent comparative operators when both operands are defined. If one
or both operator is undefined, the safe operators return FALSE while the
normal operators produce an error. Notice that =a ?<> b= returns TRUE if
both a and b are defined and they are not equal and FALSE otherwise.

The if operator returns the second operand if the first operand
evaluates to a non-zero number. Otherwise the result is undefined. Thus
an expression such as

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    test ?? "YES"
#+END_EXAMPLE
returns YES if test is 1 (or any other non-zero number); otherwise the
result is undefined. The if operator can thus be combined with the
default operator:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    test ?? "YES" ? "NO"
#+END_EXAMPLE
If an operand is not a constant, then its type depends its value; if it
looks like a number, then it is treated as a number, otherwise it is
treated as a string.

Generally, additive, multiplicative and logical operators only apply to
numeric operands. There are two cases where an arithmetic operator can
apply to string values:

- =+= :: ="ABC" + "DEF"= evaluates to ="ABCDEF"=

- =*= :: ="AB" * 3= evaluates to ="ABABAB"=

**** Substituting Symbols and Expressions

At almost any place in a GSL script, you may use a substitute construct
in the place of literal text. The format of a substitute construct is:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $( <expression> [% format] [: pretty-print] )
#+END_EXAMPLE
The construct is replaced by the value of the expression, output
according to the format and pretty-print modifiers, if they exist. The
order of the format and pretty-print modifiers is not important.

If the expression ends with a default operator that has no second
operand, and the value of the expressions result is undefined then the
substitution resolves to an empty string.

If a format string is provided, it is used to format the result before
continuing. The format string is similar to that used by the printf
function in C. It must contain exactly one conversion specification,
consisting of zero or more of the flags =#=, =0=, =-=,
and =+=, an optional minimum field width, an optional precision consisting of a 
period (=.=) followed by an optional number, and a mandatory conversion specifier among the following: =d=, =i=, =o=, =u=, =x=, =X=, =e=, =E=, =f=, =g=, =c= and =s=.
The data are always converted to the appropriate type (one of long int,
double, char or char *) for the conversion string. Note that not all
legal C format strings are allowed in GSL. See details of the C printf
function for more details. :)

The pretty-print modifier specifies how case modification and
replacement of certain characters takes place. The valid pretty-print
modifiers (not case-sensitive) are:

- =UPPER= :: UPPER CASE
- =lower= :: lower case
- =Neat= :: Neat Case Modification
- =Camel= :: camelCase
- =Pascal= :: PascalCase
- =no= :: No case modification
- =c= :: ~substitute_non_alpha_to_make_c_identifier~
- =cobol= :: ~SUBSTITUTE-NON-ALPHA-TO-MAKE-COBOL-IDENTIFIER~
- =justify= :: Text is left justified within available space
- =left= :: Entire block is shifted left as far as possible by removing the same number of spaces from each line.
- =block= :: Text over multiple lines is formatted into a block
More than one pretty-print modifier may be specified; they should be
separated by commas.

If GSL is in ignore-case mode (see below), and a substition expression
consists of a single identifier and no case-modifier is specified (c or
cobol may still be specified), the case in which the identifier name is
specified is used as an example to determine whether the case of the
result should be modified to UPPER, lower or Neat. To over-ride this,
either disable ignore-case mode or provide an empty pretty-print string.

Some examples: Assume the identifier =IDENT= has the value
=A few words from our sponsors= and identifer =XXX= is undefined.

- ~$(XXX)~ :: produces a run-time GSL error: =Undefined expression: XXX=
- ~$(XXX?"Undefined")~ :: =Undefined=
- ~$(XXX?)~ :: ~(empty string)~
- ~$(IDENT%30s)~ :: ~A FEW WORDS FROM OUR SPONSORS~
- ~$(ident:upper)~ :: ~A FEW WORDS FROM OUR SPONSORS~
- ~$(Ident)~ :: ~A Few Words From Our Sponsors~
- ~$(ident:c)~ :: ~a\_few\_words\_from\_our\_sponsors~
- ~$(IDENT:)~ :: ~A few words from our sponsors~
- ~$(1 + 1)~ :: =2=
- ~$(ident:justify)~ :: =a few words from our sponsors=

And:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    /*  $("Description:":block)\
                      $(ident:justify,block%-8s)  */
#+END_EXAMPLE

Gives:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    /*  Description:  a few                       */
    /*                words                       */
    /*                from our                    */
    /*                sponsors                    */
#+END_EXAMPLE

*What You Can Substitute*

A substitution can appear at any place in a literal string (template
line or string constant) or as an operand in an expression. It can also
replace part or all of a single identifier in a data specification, but
not a period (=.=) or member construct (=->=).

Some examples: Assume the identifier =IDENT= has the value =NUM= and
identifer =NUM= has the value =1=.

- ~$($(ident))~ gives =1=

- ~$((ident)).NAME~ gives =1.NAME= (may used in another expression as an
identifer.)

- ~$(ident)+1~ gives =NUM1=

- ~$((ident))+1~ gives =2=

** Internals
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: internals
   :END:

*** Internal Variables
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: internal-variables
    :END:

GSL has a series of internal variables, described below, that influence
its behaviour in various ways. These variables are held in the scope
=gsl= and can be modified by an instruction of the form:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    [gsl].xxxxx = yyyy
#+END_EXAMPLE

You can also set the initial value of these variables when starting GSL
by using a command of the form:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    gsl -xxxxx:yyyy somescript.gsl
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Template and Script Modes
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: template-and-script-modes
    :END:

Lines of GSL may be either script lines or template lines. GSL has two
different modes for distinguishing script from template lines. In
template mode, lines are assumed to be template lines unless they begin
with a period (=.=). In script mode, lines are assumed to be script
lines unless they begin with a greater-than symbol (=>=).

GSL starts in one of these modes, depending on the manner in which is
was invoked. If it was invoked using an XML file as an argument, it
begins in template mode as it is assumed that the XML file is to be used
as data for creating an output file. If GSL was invoked using a GSL file
as an argument, it begins in script mode.

You can change between template and script mode with the =template= and
=endtemplate= commands. See the description of these commands below for
details.

*** Template Lines
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: template-lines
    :END:

The simplest template line is just text, which is copied verbatim to the
current output file. If no output file has been opened, or if the last
output file has been closed, the output is copied to the standard
output.

The backslash (=\=) serves several special functions in a template line.
Firstly, if the last character of an template line is a backslash, then
the line is output with no line terminator; otherwise a line terminator
follows the template line. Secondly, a backslash introduces one of three
special character sequences: =\n=, =\r= and =\t= which are replaced by a
line feed, carriage return and a tabulation character (TAB)
respectively. Thirdly, a backslash followed by and other character is
replaced by that character; this allows characters which would normally
be interpreted as script commands to be output literally.

*** Script Lines
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: script-lines
    :END:

The script commands are described below.

If a script command line ends with a backslash (=\=), then the following
script line is treated as a continuation of the current line.

*** Comments
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: comments
    :END:

There are three ways to include comments in GSL scripts. The first is to
place a hyphen (=-=) as the first character of a script line, or
following the point (=.=) in a template line. The second way is to place
a hash (=#=) after a GSL command. Any characters following the hyphen
are ignored by GSL. The third way is to enclose comment text (which may
continue over more than one line) inside comment markers (=/*= and =*/=)
just as in C. However if GSL finds these characters in a template line
(but not inside a substitution) it assumes that they are destined for
output, so does not treat them as a comment.

Examples:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .- This entire line is a comment

    .output "file"  # This is a trailing comment

    .output /* This is an embedded
    multi-line comment */ "file"

    If this is a template line, then /* this is not a comment */

    $("but "/* this is */)
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Ignorecase
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: ignorecase
    :END:

GSL has two modes which influence case-sensitivity of identifier names.
In the first mode (ignore-case), GSL is case-insensitive regarding
identifier names and instead as a guide to modifying the output string,
as described above (=Case Sensitivity=). In the second mode
(case-sensitive), GSL treats the case of identifier names as
significant. You can change the behaviour by setting the value of the
attribute =ignorecase= in the scope =gsl= to 1 for ignore case and 0 for
case sensitivity.

*** Shuffle
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: shuffle
    :END:

GSL can help to keep code neat by enlarging or shrinking white space so
that column numbers match as far as possible between the script and the
output file. For instance, if the value of the identifier ~X~ is ~ABCDEF~,
then:
#+begin_example
    $(X)   .
#+end_example
evaluates to
#+begin_example
    ABCDEF .
#+end_example
but
#+begin_example
    $(X?"Undefined") .
#+end_example
evaluates to
#+begin_example
    ABCDEF .
#+end_example

The shuffle algorithm uses the value of the attribute =shuffle= of the
gsl scope). It expands a block of white space no shorter than =shuffle=
as much as necessary so that the text following the white space is
output in the same column. It also shrinks white space down to a minimum
of =shuffle= to make space for text preceeding the white space. If
=shuffle= is zero, then shuffle is disabled. The default value of
=shuffle= is 2; this is the value which produces the results shown
above.

If the current output ends with a backslash, then the shuffle continues
on the following line. Thus

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $(X?"Undefined")\\
             .
#+END_EXAMPLE
evaluates to
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ABCDEF   .
#+END_EXAMPLE

Shuffle can cause problems in some cases, for example when outputting
literal text where the size of white space is important. In this case
shuffle should be disabled by setting the value to zero.

*** COBOL
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: cobol
    :END:

GSL helps you make neat COBOL code by automatically filling the first
six characters of each line with the four-digit line number followed by
two zeroes. To enable this function set the value of the attribute
=cobol= in the gsl scope to 1.

*** Line Terminators
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: line-terminators
    :END:

GSL uses as its line terminator the value of of the attribute
=terminator= of the gsl scope. The default value is "~\n~" but it could
also be set to "~\r\n~", for example.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    \# for Windows batch scripts
    \.terminator="\r\n"
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Escape Symbol
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: escape-symbol
    :END:

GSL uses the backslash "~\~" as its default escape symbol, mainly due to
its POSIX / C roots. This can be very annoying in templates that have a
lot of backslashes. You can override the escape symbol by changing the
~[gsl].escape~ attribute, or using the ~-escape:X~ command-line switch.

Note that this takes effect for the next script loaded, so you cannot
use this in a script to modify how that script itself is processed. You
can use it before e.g. including a script.

*** Substitute Symbol
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: substitute-symbol
    :END:

GSL uses the string =$(= to open a substitution sequence. You can use
any string instead, by changing the ~[gsl].substitute~ attribute, or using
the ~-substitute:X~ command-line switch.

Note that this takes effect for the next script loaded, so you cannot
use this in a script to modify how that script itself is processed. You
can use it before e.g. including a script.

Note also that the closing symbol is always =)= and you cannot override
this.

*** Arguments
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: arguments
    :END:

If GSL is invoked with a =-a= switch, all arguments following the first
are treated as arguments to the first script, rather than as further
arguments to GSL, as would otherwise be the case. So if you type:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    gsl -a myscript.gsl localhost 80
#+END_EXAMPLE
GSL defines attributes =arg1= in the symbol table =switches= in scope
=gsl= with value =localhost= and attribute =arg2= with value =80=. A GSL
script can access these values with an instruction of the form:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    echo switches.arg1
#+END_EXAMPLE
or in a loop:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    n = 1
    echo switches.arg$(n)
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Predefined Identifiers
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: predefined-identifiers
    :END:

There are some identifiers whose value is maintained by GSL in the
global space referred to by the predefined scopes =gsl= and =global=.
They are defined as attributes of the global item.

- =script= :: The name of the GSL script file currently being processed.
- =filename= :: The name of the XML file being processed.
- =outfile= :: The name of the current output file; undefined if there is none.
- =line= :: The line number of the line currently being output to the output file.
- =me= :: The name of the current application: GSL.
- =version= :: The version of the current application.
- =switches= :: A symbol table holding all the command-line switches present when GSL was invoked.

** Built-In Functions
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: built-in-functions
   :END:

GSL provides many built-in functions and uses =modules= to group related
functions.
Functions are listed under their module name. Each function listing
shows the arguments it accepts. Optional arguments are shown with square
brackets '~[]~'.

If an optional argument is provided, then previous arguments must also
be provided. For example, the function =directory.open([name], [error])=
accepts two optional arguments. If the =error= argument is provided,
then the =name= argument must also be provided.
Some functions take no arguments.
If a function is given an incorrect number of errors GSL will print an
error on the console and terminate.

If the provided arguments are of the wrong type or otherwise incorrect,
the functions will return an undefined result, which can be handled with
the default operator and tested with the defined() function.

Some functions accept an optional parameter, listed as =error=. If the
parameter is provided, and an error occurs, the associated error text
will be placed in the parameter and can be used as shown in this
example.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        dir = directory.open(".", error_text) ?
        
        if ! defined(dir)
           abort "E: cannot open directory: " + error_text

    alias (item)
        To be explained.

    class (item)
        Returns the class name for the scope of item.

    count  ([<scope> .] <child> [, <expr> [, [<alias>]]]):
        counts the number of children of the supplied or most recently opened scope
        of the given name.  If an expression is specified, it is treated as
        a condition to determine which children are counted.  In this case,
        a new stacked scope is implicitly defined while the condition is
        evaluated.  The name of this scope is the name of the XML item, unless
        an alias is specified.  For compatibility with earlier versions of GSL,
        if no alias is specified, then a second, unstacked scope called `count'
        and referring to the same XML item is created.
        For example: count (ITEM, ITEM.NAME = "ABC")
        returns the number of children of the most recently opened scope whose
        attribute NAME has the value `ABC'.

    defined (value)
        True if value is defined.

    first ()

*** fileio
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: fileio
    :END:

GSL provides three modules for dealing with directories and files; one
directory module and two file modules, one for working with independent
files and the second for working with files during a directory
traversal. We will discuss the second set after the first because it
will make more sense that way.

Abstractedly, the modules have functions for working on, working with,
and finding out about directories and files.

In the first category, directories have the =create= and =delete=
functions which make them appear and disappear, modulo file permissions
and other errors. Files also have the same functions, but =create= is
spelled =open=. In addition, files have functions to =rename= and =copy=
them. An important note: while it is generally important to check for
errors in most operations, these operations almost demand checking for
errors. Use of the default operator and error parameter will be well
rewarded with working programs.

The second set of functions deal with the "contents" of directories and
files.

A directory's purpose is to contain other files (directories are also
files of a particular type). The only content operation is =open=, which
returns a 'directory entry' object that can be used to iterate through
the directory contents.

Files are a little richer and have operations to open them and to read
from or write to them and to control where in the file to read or write.

File IO always begin with an open call, which returns a file handle.

The file handle is used in all subsequent content operations on that
file. When the text refers to operations that affect the =handle=, keep
in mind that this is short hand for the longer 'operations that affect
the file that the handle represents'. The file is actually what is
being worked on.

When opening a file, the =mode= parameter, a single letter, states how
you intend to use the file, whether for 'r'eading, 'w'riting, or
'a'ppending.

Reading can be done with file.read(handle, [error]). Writing is done in
a corresponding manner. Reading can also be done with function
=file.slurp=, which returns the contents of the file. It is a shortcut
to a common operation.

A file handle maintains an internal current file offset, which is a
byte offset from the beginning of the file tells it where the next
read or write should occur. A file opened for reading or writing will
start of with an offset of 0, whereas a file opened for append mode
will start with an offset corresponding to the end of the file.

The offset changes to reflect any read or write operations on the
file.  This is actually more than one needs to know just to read or
write a file. However, it is sometimes useful and necessary to skip
around inside a file, which is what =tell= and =seek= do. The function
=tell= returns the current offset and =seek= changes the offset.

The final set of file functions manipulate files, file names and file
metadata.

*** Directory Iteration
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: directory-iteration
    :END:

As mentioned, previously, directories can be opened with the
=directory.open= function, which returns a 'directory entry' object. The
'directory object' represents a tree structure with child elements
corresponding to the contents of the directory and can be iterated with
a for/endfor loop. A child element is either a 'directory entry' or a
'file entry', depending on the file type. Both file and directory
entries have a name() function, which returns 'file' or 'directory', as
appropriate.

The loop

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    for dir. as elt

    endfor
#+END_EXAMPLE

will allow access to all child elements, but, of course, the loop could
be limited to files with

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     for dir.file
     endfor
#+END_EXAMPLE

or directories with

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    for dir.directory

    endfor
#+END_EXAMPLE

During iteration, the File Entry functions can be called on current
item. These are similar to their corresponding File functions but do not
take a =handle= parameter. Note that the =open= function reads all
directory entries at start so any changes to the file system until the
next open call. Also, iteration is only defined over files and
directories; non file or directory entries are ignored. The open call
will fail if the target is not a directory or it cannot find any valid
files or directories in the target directory.

The directory entry has the attributes:

- =path=
- =name=

and the file entry has the following attributes:

- =path=
- =name=
- =size=
- =time=
- =date=

Which return the appropriate values from the file (or directory, which
is, of course, a file).

The following example shows some of the attributes in use:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        dir = directory.open(".", error_text) ?
        
        if defined(dir)
          for dir.file as f
              echo "file:$(f.name) has size: $(f.size)"
          endfor
        else
            abort "Error: " + error_text
        endif
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note that:

If the directory entry =name= attribute is changed, the actual directory
name is also changed. However, this operation does not return an error
and cannot be recommended.

The file entry's default attribute is =name= so =f.= is the same as
=f.name=. Directory entries don't have this default attribute so it's
only useful when working with file entries.

File.open returns a File Entry object, so some of the file operations
can be shortened a bit. For instance, file.read(handle) could also be
written as =handle.read()=.

MODULE: GSL/fileio package

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Class: Directory

        Function: directory . open ([path],[error])
                      Opens directory at `path` for iteration.
          `path` is opened relative to current directory.
          If `path` is not provided, uses the current directory.
          
          On success, returns a file entry for the first file in the directory.
          On error, returns an undefined value and sets `error`, if provided.

          Note: In addition to permission, type, or existence errors, open will
          fail if the directory is empty since an empty directory has no entries.

        Function: directory . setcwd (path,[error])
                    Changes current working directory to `path`.
        Returns 0 on success.
        Returns -1 on error and sets `error`, if provided.

        Function: directory . create (path)
                    Creates directory `path`.
        On success returns 0.
        On error, returns -1 (does not accept an error parameter).

        Notes:
        Can create multiple levels of directories, similar to 'mkdir -p' on unix.
        Will return success on directories already exist. Note that this is true
        even if the user does not access to said directory. Existence is all.
        If created, directories have permission 0775.

        Function: directory . delete (path,[error])
                    Removes directory at `path`.
        On success, returns 0.
        On error, returns -1 and sets `error`, if provided.
        Note: will fail on non-empty directory.

        Function: directory . resolve (path,[separator])
                  Locates `path` relative to current directory.

      If the path looks like an absolute directory, returns the cleaned up path.
      Otherwise appends the path to the current directory and returns the cleaned up result.
      
      Cleans-up the returned path by appending a '/' if necessary, and resolving any '..' subpaths.

      If `separator`, a single character, is provided the resulting path components are separated by `separator`
      path components instead of the default separator (which depends on the operating system).


    Class: File

        Function: file . open (filename,[mode],[error])
                      Opens `filename` with `mode` for reading or writing, depending on `mode`.

          If mode is 'r', the file is opened for reading. Default if mode is not provided.
          If mode is 'w', the file is opened for writing. Empties file first.
          If mode is 'a', the file is opened for appending to existing content.

          On success, returns a file handle.
          On error, returns undefined and sets `error`, if provided.

        Function: file . read (handle,[error])
                    Reads a line from file `handle` .
        On success, returns content read.
        On error, returns undefined and sets `error`, if provided.

        Function: file . write (handle,string,[error])
                    Writes `string` to file `handle`.

        On success, returns 0.
        On error, returns -1 and sets `error`, if provided.

        Function: file . close (handle,[error])
                    Closes file `handle`.

        On success, returns 0.
        On error, returns -1 and sets `error`, if provided.

        Function: file . tell (handle,[error])
                    Returns the current file offset of `handle`.
        The next `read` or `write` will start at that offset.
        
        On success, returns offset, a number.
        On error, returns undefined and sets `error`, if provided.

        Function: file . seek (handle,[offset],[error])
                    Moves current file offset to `offset`, a number, in file `handle`.

        If `offset` is -1, seeks to end of file, otherwise seeks
        to specified offset in file.

        On success, returns 0.
        On error, returns -1 and sets `error`, if provided.

        Note: offset 0 is the beginning of the file.

        Function: file . slurp (filename,[error])
                    Reads the entire content of `filename`.

        On success, returns data read.
        On error, returns undefined and sets `error`, if provided.

        Function: file . exists (filename,[error])
                        Tests for file (or directory) existence.

            Returns 1 if the file exists.
            Returns 0 if the file does not exist and sets `error`, if provided.

        Function: file . timestamp (filename,[error])
                        Returns the modification date and time of `filename`,
            a file or directory name, as a number in the format YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.

            On success, returns a value.
            On error, returns -1 and sets `error`, if provided.

        Function: file . rename (oldname,newname,[error])
                    Renames file or directory `oldname` to `newname`.
        On success, returns 0.
        On error, returns -1 and sets `error`, if provided.

        Function: file . delete (filename,[error])
                    Deletes file `filename`.

        On success, returns 0.
        On error, returns -1 and sets `error`, if provided.

        Function: file . locate (filename,[path],[error])
                      Searches for `filename` in a specified set of directories.
          If provided, `path` is first considered an environment variable
          and used to find the corresponding value. If there is no such value,
          `path` is used as is. If `path` is not provided, the environment variable
          `PATH` is used instead. If path is a literal, it is expected to be a list
          of directories separated by the default separator for the operating system.

          The current directory is implicitly prepended to the list and searched first.

          On success, returns the fully qualified path to the file.
          On error, returns undefined and sets `error`, if provided.

        Function: file . copy (src,dest,[mode],[error])
                    Copies file `src` to `dest` using `mode`.

        `mode` determines how the file is copied;
        'b' for binary mode, 't' for text mode.
        The distinction only matters on DOS (and derivatives?).
        'b' is the default.

        On success, returns 1.
        On error, returns -1 and sets `error`, if provided.

        Note: if `dst` exists, returns 1 and skips the copy operation.
        This could be considered a feature.

        Function: file . basename (filename)
                    Removes dot and extension, if any, from `filename`.
        If `filename` contains multiple extensions, removes the last one.
        
        Returns an appropriately shorn string or `filename`, unchanged.


    Class: Directory


    Class: File

        Function: <file entry> . open ([mode],[error])
                    Opens the file with `mode`; 'r', 'w', or 'a'.

        On error, returns -1 and sets `error`, if provided.

        Function: <file entry> . read ([error])
                    Reads a line from file.
        On success, returns line read.
        On error, returns undefined and sets `error`, if provided.

        Function: <file entry> . write (string,[error])
                    Writes the string to file.
        On success, returns 0.
        On error, returns -1 and sets `error`, if provided.

        Function: <file entry> . close ([error])
                    Closes the file.
        On success, returns 0.
        On error, returns -1 and sets `error`, if provided.

        Function: <file entry> . tell ([error])

        Function: <file entry> . seek ([offset],[error])
                    Seeks to `offset`. See File.seek for details.
        On success, returns 0.

    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: output-file-manipulation
    :END:

*.output*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .output <filename>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Closes the current output file, if one is open, and opens a new one.

Examples:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .output "myfile.c"
    .output FILENAME
#+END_EXAMPLE

Where FILENAME is an identifier whose value is the desired file name.

*.append*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .append <filename>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Closes the current output file, if one is open, and opens a previously
existing one and prepares to extend it. See the description of the
output command for examples.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .close
#+END_EXAMPLE

Closes the current output file, if one is open.

*.literal*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .literal [ from <filename> | " <text> " | << <terminator> ]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Copies text directly to the output file, without substition. The text
can come from another file, a GSL expression, or from lines in the
script, ending with a line beginning with the specified terminator.

Examples:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .literal from "file.txt"

    .literal "whatever you want"

    .literal << .endliteral

*** Control Structures
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: control-structures
    :END:

*.for*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .for [[<data-specifier>] .] <name> [as <alias> | noalias] [nostack] [where <expr>] [by <expr>]
    .for  [<data-specifier>] .         [as <alias> | noalias] [nostack] [where <expr>] [by <expr>]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Opens a scope and introduces a loop. The following block of code is
processed once for each item specified. If no scope if specified, the
most recently opened scope is assumed. The items processed are those
children of the XML item corresponding to this scope. If the first form
is used only children with the specified name are processed; if the
second form is used, all children are processed.

The alias allows you to give the new scope a name other than the
specified item name; use this when you nest scopes which would otherwise
have the same name or to supply a scope name when using the second form.

The =where= clause allows you to specify a condition which must be
satisfied for the code to be processed; the expression is evaluated
before any processing occurs.

The =by= clause allows you to sort the items according to the result of
evaluating the expression for each item. If no by clause is specified
the items are processed from the oldest to the youngest, the same order
in which they are described in the XML file.

The expressions in the =where= and =by= clauses are evaluated within the
new scope. This means that they can access attributes of the iterating
item.

During the evaluation of the =by= and =where= expressions, as well as
during the processing of the code, the function =item (name)= returns
the number of the child (1, 2, ...) of the current item. This number is
associated with the XML item itself and is not affected by a =by= or
=where= clause.

Within the loop, but not within =by= and =where= expressions, the
function =index (name)= returns the index of the current iteration. This
is associated with the loop, so that it always takes consecutive values.

If there are no items to iterate, an optional .else clause is executed.

*.endfor*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .endfor [<scope>]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Terminates a .for loop, closing the scope. The scope name is optional
and does not affect the operation. GSL confirms that its value is the
name of the scope to be closed and reports an error if this is not the
case. In this way, GSL can be made to validate nested .for loops for
you.

Examples:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .for RECORD.FIELD by NAME
    $(FIELD.NAME)
    .endfor
#+END_EXAMPLE

Outputs the names of the fields of the current record, sorted in
alphabetical order.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .for FIELD as PASTURE where item () = 2
    something
    .else
    somethine else
    .endfor PASTURE
#+END_EXAMPLE

Processes only the second item named FIELD, and executes an .else clause
if there is no such item.

*.if*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .if <expr>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Starts conditional processing of the following block of code if the
result of evaluating the expression is non-zero.

*.elsif*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .elsif <expr>
#+END_EXAMPLE

May follow an =if= construct. Any number of =elsif= constructs may be
used.

*.else*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .else
#+END_EXAMPLE

May follow an =if= or =elsif= or a =for= construct. The following block
of code is processed if the logical value of all the expressions is
FALSE.

*.endif*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .endif
#+END_EXAMPLE

Terminates a conditional processing construct.

Examples:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .if NAME = "JAMES"
    something
    .elsif NAME = "JAIME"
    something else
    .else
    everything else
    .endif
#+END_EXAMPLE

*.while*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .while <expr>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Introduces a loop. The following block of code is processed repeatedly
as long as the expression evaluates to a logical value of TRUE, that is
not equal to zero. Expression evaluation takes place before the code is
processed, so that the code will never be processed if the expression
evaluates to FALSE the first time.

*.endwhile*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .endwhile
#+END_EXAMPLE

Terminates a =while= loop.

Examples:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .define I = 0
    .while I < 5
    loop iteration number $(I)
    .I += 1
    .endwhile
#+END_EXAMPLE

*.next*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .next [<scope>]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Inside a =for= or =while= loop, causes immediate iteration, skipping
execution of any code between the =next= command and the =endfor= or
=endwhile= statement. If the scope is specified, then the =for= loop
corresponding to that scope is iterated.

*.last*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .last [<scope>]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Inside a =for= or =while= loop, causes the loop to terminate iteration
immediately. Control passes to the line following the =endfor= or
=endwhile= statement. If the scope is specified, then the =for= loop
corresponding to that scope is terminated.

*** Scope Manipulation
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: scope-manipulation
    :END:

*.scope*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .scope <data-specifier> [as <alias> | noalias] [nostack]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Opens a new scope corresponding to the specified data.

*.endscope*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .endscope [<scope>]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Terminates a block opened with a =.scope= command, closing the scope.
The scope name is optional and does not affect the operation. GSL
confirms that its value is the name of the scope to be closed and
reports an error if this is not the case. In this way, GSL can be made
to validate nested =.scope= blocks for you.

*** Symbol Definition
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: symbol-definition
    :END:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .<data-specifier> [<operator>]= [ <expr> ]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Defines or undefines an XML attribute or item value. There are several
different forms, described below:

If the scope is omitted from the data specification, GSL searches
stacked scopes, from inner to outer, for one in which an attribute of
the specified name exists. If none is found, it uses the outermost
stacked scope, which effectively makes the identifier a global variable.

If the expression is left empty, then the symbol becomes undefined. If
the expression ends with a default operator =?= but no default
expression, then an undefined expression causes the symbol to become
undefined rather than producing a runtime error.

If an arithmetic or default operator is specified, then the value
assigned to the symbol is the result of that operator and the supplied
expression to the former value of the operator.

Examples:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .x = 1
#+END_EXAMPLE

Assigns the value 1 to the identifier x in the most recently opened open
scope where x is already defined, or in the global scope if x is
undefined.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .->child. = "Value"
#+END_EXAMPLE

Assigns the string =Value= to the value of the first child of the
innermost stacked scope.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .x *= 2
#+END_EXAMPLE

Multiplies the value of the identifier x by 2.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .x ?= y ? z ?
#+END_EXAMPLE

Does nothing if =x= is already defined; otherwise assigns it the value
of =y=, or if =y= is undefined, then the value of =z=, or if =z= is
undefined, =x= remains undefined.

*** Structured Data Manipulation
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: structured-data-manipulation
    :END:

*.new*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .new [[<data-specifier>] . <name>] [before <before-scope> | after <after-scope>] [as <alias> | noalias] [nostack]
    .new <name> [to <data-specifier> | before <before-scope> | after <after-scope>] [as <alias> | noalias] [nostack]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Creates a new XML item. This allows you to build new items in the data
tree. The new item has the specified name and is a child of the XML item
corresponding to th specified scope, or the most recently opened scope
if none is specified. If a =before-scope= or =after-scope= is specified,
then it must be the name of an open scope corresponding to a child of
=<data-specifier>=, and the new item is inserted just before
=<before-scope>= or just after =<after-scope>=; otherwise the new item
is inserted after any existing children. The construct creates a new
scope with the name specified by the alias or the item name if there is
no alias. The following block of code is processed exactly once within
this new scope. It would typically set some attributes of the new XML
item. These values can then be retrieved during a future iteration of a
=for= construct through the new item.

*.endnew*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .endnew [<scope>]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Terminates a =new= construct. The scope name is optional and does not
affect the operation. GSL confirms that its value is the name of the
scope to be closed and reports an error if this is not the case. In this
way, GSL can be made to validate nested .new blocks for you.

Examples:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .new RECORD.FIELD
    .    define FIELD.NAME = "NEW FIELD"
    .endnew

    .for RECORD.FIELD as OLDFIELD where NAME = "OLD FIELD"
    .    new RECORD.FIELD before OLDFIELD
    .        define FIELD.NAME = "NEW FIELD"
    .    endnew
    .endfor
#+END_EXAMPLE

*.delete*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .delete <data-specifier>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Deletes the data item corresponding to the specified scope. Once the
item has been deleted, any attempt to reference it produces an error.

Examples:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .for RECORD.FIELD where TYPE = "COMMENT"
    .    delete FIELD
    .endfor
#+END_EXAMPLE

*.copy*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .copy [<from-scope>] [ to <parent-data> | after <after-scope> | before <before-scope> ] [as <name>]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Makes a copy the of XML item associated with =<from-scope>= (or the most
recently opened scope if not specified) at the point specified by either
the new parent (=to=) or new sibling (=after= or =before=), or as a
child of the XML item of the most recently opened scope if no parent of
sibling is specified. The =as= clause allows you to the new item to have
a different name from the old item.

Examples:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .for DATABASE.TABLE
    .    for RECORD.FIELD
    .        copy FIELD to TABLE
    .    endfor
    .endfor
#+END_EXAMPLE

*.move*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .move [<from-data>] [ to <parent-data> | after <after-data> | before <before-data> ] [as <name>]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Re-attaches a data item at the point specified by a =to=, =after= or
=before= clause, renaming it to the name specified in the =as= clause,
if specified.

GSL detects any attempt to make an item its own descendent.

Note that moving an item does not invalidate any scope associated with
it. If the moved item is associated with a future iteration of a =for=
loop, the iteration will still take place even if the item is no longer
a child of the extended scope from the =for= instruction.

Examples:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .for TABLE.RECORD
    .    for RECORD.FIELD
    .        move FIELD to RECORD
    .    endfor
    .endfor
#+END_EXAMPLE

*.sort*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .sort [[<data-specifier>] .] [<name>] [as <alias>] by <expr>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Sorts the specified items. A scope is created with each item in turn and
is used to evaluate the expression. The result is then used to sort the
items. The =as= clause allows you to give the created scope a different
name. After execution, the specified items are in order and after any
other children of the same parent.

*** Script Manipulation
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: script-manipulation
    :END:

*.include*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .include <filename>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Includes another script file. Deprecated - see =gsl=

*.gsl*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .gsl [ from <filename> | <expr> ]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Interprets the contents of the specified file or expression as GSL, just
as though it were part of the script.

Examples:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .gsl from "header.gsl"
    .gsl GSL.TEXT
#+END_EXAMPLE

*.template*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .template (0 | 1)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Turns template mode on or off.

*.endtemplate*

Terminates the block introduced by a =template= instruction.

*** Macros and Functions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: macros-and-functions
    :END:

Macros and functions are pieces of GSL which can be invoked with
parameters. The only difference between a macro and a function is that
macros are interpreted in template mode and functions in script mode.

Just like other data, macros and functions are attached to scopes, and
can only be used within that scope.

When a macro or function executes, an unstacked scope is opened with the
same name as the macro or function. An unstacked alias to this scope
called =my= is also created. Parameters accessed via the =my= alias are
flattened and parameters accessed via the macro or function name scope
are not.

The macro or function-named scope and the =my alias= can also be used
for local variables, thus enabling full recursion.

*.macro*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .macro [global .] <name> [(<param> [, <param>] ...)]
#+END_EXAMPLE

introduces a macro definition with the specified name.

*.endmacro*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .endmacro
#+END_EXAMPLE

Terminates a macro definition.

*.function*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .function [global .] <name> [([<param>] [, <param>] ...)]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Introduces a function definition with the specified name.

*.endfunction*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .endfunction <name>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Terminates a function definition.

*.return*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .return [<expression>]
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Calling a function*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .[<scope> .] <function-name> [([<expr>] [, [<expr>]])] ...)]
#+END_EXAMPLE

A macro or function can also be invoked as an expression. In this case,
the expression value is that which is returned, or is undefined if there
is no =return= statement.

This creates a special scope with the name of the macro or function, and
attributes corresponding to the values of the parameters. This scope
does not count in numeric scope specifications and cannot have children.
It can be used to define local variables, but must in this case be
specified by name.

The number of expressions (or empty expressions) must match exactly the
number of parameters in the definition. An empty expression or an
expression whose value is undefined causes the corresponding parameter
to be undefined during processing of the macro code.

Examples:

The script

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    .macro echotwice (text)
    .    echo echotwice.text
    .    echo my.text
    .endmacro
    .
    .echotwice ("Hello World!")
#+END_EXAMPLE

produces

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Hello World!
    Hello World!
#+END_EXAMPLE

The script
